# Comparison of classification algorithms in marketing forecasting
Data Science project comparing the efficiency of machine learning classification algorithms in forecasting results of bank marketing campaign. This was done by realizing Data Science LLifecycle and training multiple machine learning models on different classification algorithms and comparing them. 

Data set used was obtained from [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/).

Project is split into multiple Python notebooks in order to segment each step of project.

Classification algorithms tested in this projects:
- Logistic regression
- K-nearest neighbors
- Naive Bayes classifier
- Decision tree classifier
- Random forest classifier
- Support vector machine classifier
